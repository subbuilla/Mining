used IMDB Dataset for Movies
Spotify Dataset for songs

Developed a Recommender System that recommends songs and movies based on analyzing sentiment of a tweet or a text. Used LSTM-RNN from keras inorder to perform sentiment analysis.

If the predicted sentiment is happy: pop and hip-hop songs are recommended / thriller,action,romance/drama movies are recommended
If the predicted sentiment is sad: Rock and Heavy Metal songs are recommended / Action-Comedy , Sci-fi Movies are recommended
However these could be changed according to the particular user.
